# Cricket-Score-Prediction-project
A Data Science project of Predicting  the Score From the current Score and Run-rate 
# Algorithm Used For The Prediction
For Predicting the Score I Have Used a Random Forest Regressor Algorithm  Even Though the Mean Absolute 
error is 11% which Denotes that the model Being Implemented has an Accuracy of 89%
# Essential Modules Required For the Project
Numpy, Pandas, pickle, and Sklearn are the essential Libraries Which are Used in this Project.
# Environments Used to Execute the Project
* Jupyter Notebook along with Anaconda for Taking and Extracting the Information from the
  The data set then Choosing Model for the prediction.
# Important Note
* All the Extensions and Environments Which are utilised must be of the same version (Python 3.11.5 )
